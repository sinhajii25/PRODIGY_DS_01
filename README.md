# PRODIGY_DS_01

This project is a part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.  
It visualizes the gender and age distribution in a sample population using Python data visualization libraries.

## Project Objective

To explore and visualize a dataset containing gender and age information to understand demographic trends.  
This project helps in building skills related to:

- Data preprocessing  
- Categorical and continuous data visualization  
- Working with real-world datasets
